# Welcome to femtoGPT!

This open-source project aims to develop a lightweight and efficient AI model capable of achieving impressive results despite limited data and computational resources. This innovative approach focuses on:

- **Tiny Footprint**: The model is designed with a minimal number of parameters, making it suitable for deployment on devices with low processing power and memory constraints.
- **Economical Data Training**: The model will be trained using specialized algorithms that require significantly less data compared to traditional AI models.
- **Resource-Friendly Inference**: The model will be optimized for efficient inference, minimizing the computational power needed to run predictions.

This project aims to democratize AI by making it accessible to individuals and organizations with limited resources.

Join us in building a powerful and accessible AI for everyone!
